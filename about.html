                <h2>A Patient and Meticulous Approach</h2>
                <p>I take great pride in my ability to connect with students and understand their unique needs. Patience is
                    key when working with anyone, and I always make sure to observe attentively, allowing them to
                    work on problems at their own pace.</p>
                <p>Not everyone understands the same concepts at the same rate. I stay flexible with my approach to teaching
                    to better fit students' learning patterns.</p>
